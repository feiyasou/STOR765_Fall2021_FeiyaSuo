1,All in-person lectures and small groups,,fairly interactive but limited,Neither difficult nor easy,Disagree,Strongly agree,"no shadowing allowed, not even virtual was a terrible decision and limited exposure to our field","limited my ability to connect and ask questions in the large group, had less trouble in zoom small groups, but overall less than ideal"
2,All in-person lectures and small groups,,"Zoom format allows vast interactive features when given appropriate time to set up; although the more interactive the lecture, the less content can be taught",Easy,Agree,Disagree,"For unknown reasons, there was significantly more attendance and participation during virtual office hours during the 100% remote time period",There are lots of benefits to teaching virtually but those benefits cannot be experienced if faculty does not have at least double the time to prepare and build out a solid virtual format
3,All virtual course,,"minimal, some questions in the chat",Difficult,Disagree,Neutral,Hard to know. Still have had many students express interest in dermatology after the integument week despite the all virtual format.,
4,All in-person lectures and small groups,,a little,Difficult,Neutral,Agree,"in some ways it was good because it allowed us to reach more, but in some ways it was hard because we typically have a lot of med students rotating through our inpatient service and our clinics, and without that it is hard to impress upon them our love of our specialty","acceptable, but not optimal for large group meetings (for me), but really challenging for connecting on a personal level"
5,All in-person lectures and small groups,,Somewhat,Difficult,Disagree,Strongly agree,Lack of personal conversations,

8,Other,Live virtual plus small group,Very,Very easy,Strongly disagree,Strongly disagree,Students and faculty preferred having to spend no time on commute,
9,All in-person lectures and small groups,,"I have little experience I taught PCC virtually As a ""consumer"" ZOOM was much more convenient, but personal interaction was poor",Difficult,Disagree,Agree,"I no longer perform surgery, but it adversely affected the education of students by our division members.",It's not possible to teach or observe physical exam skills via ZOOM It was not possible to split the group up
10,All in-person lectures and small groups,,"Only slightly less interactive than in person, but just with a less intimate and enthusiastic feel",Neither difficult nor easy,Neutral,Neutral,"In some ways it was beneficial in helping connect to students who are not currently in town. But as above, it just didn't feel like I could get to know them as effectively and efficiently as in person.",
11,Other,Assuming pandemic improved/in person is safe,Somewhat- depends upon participants,Neither difficult nor easy,Disagree,Neutral,,
12,All in-person lectures and small groups,,fairly intractive,Neither difficult nor easy,Neutral,Strongly agree,I was unable to have them follow me in person. I also do telehealth in corrections and i was unable to get them to be able to work with me as well,
13,Live stream lecture and in-person small groups,,minimally,Difficult,Neutral,Strongly agree,Preclinical students have a hard time conceptualizing what a day of work looks like for anything other than a primary care MD.,Virtual small group greatly reduces the reward of teaching a small group and makes it more of a burden
14,All in-person lectures and small groups,,Moderately less so than in person,Difficult,Neutral,Agree,Many students approach me after in-person lectures to discuss topics and ask about the field.

18,Live stream lecture and in-person small groups,,somewhat,Difficult,Strongly disagree,Strongly agree,we were unable to have early medical students shadow in clinic and limited their access to developing interest in dermatology,"students were great, in person small group would be easier"
19,All in-person lectures and small groups,,When the chat function is used can be reasonable but much less interactive than live,Easy,Disagree,Strongly agree,There are less questions so less time getting personal information about what we love in our specialty,
20,All in-person lectures and small groups,,"not as interactive as in person, and more effort to make so",Neither difficult nor easy,Neutral,Strongly agree,severely limited the opportunities,technical difficulties sometimes wasted time
21,All in-person lectures and small groups,,somewhat,Very easy,Neutral,Neutral,,
22,All in-person lectures and small groups,,not very,Neither difficult nor easy,Agree,Strongly agree,talking about an area of interest is not the same as seeing patients with given diseases,
23,All in-person lectures and small groups,,Can be somewhat if well planned and students engaged,Difficult,Disagree,Agree,No ability to allow shadowing. Students unable to spend time in the community exploring different practices and populations,"To clarify: Virtual teaching POSITIVELY affected my self care allowed me additional flexibility to spend more time with my family, join them on vacations and teach remotely while being out of town caring for self and family "
24,All in-person lectures and small groups,,"Zoom lectures can be quite interactive, but this takes substantially more time than an equivalent in-person session, so the process seemed less efficient",Neither difficult nor easy,Neutral,Neutral,,
25,All in-person lectures and small groups,,"The zoom format for our large group lectures were very well designed They included virtual breakout rooms, which allowed students to discuss the material as if they were in person",Neither difficult nor easy,Neutral,Neutral,,"It was slightly more difficult to make sure I circulated among the zoom rooms equally, but otherwise it was not a burden"

28,All in-person lectures and small groups,,Pretty good; students are interactive when prompted and asking questions on their own,Easy,Strongly agree,Disagree,,"Overall, it worked well for large lecture classes, but not well for small group classes that were taught in large group This was more organizational than an inherent problem with virtual teaching (ie one instructor talked too much that didn't leave sufficient time for all of the material to be discussed)"
29,Live stream lecture and in-person small groups,,hard to get students to turn on cameras sometimes,Easy,Agree,Strongly agree,my PCC students wanted to shadow me in the hospital but it was not allowed,"the silver lining is the decreased commuting time for us and for the students, also the ability to connect with students in other parts of the state"
